8 <-- number of sets in cache (will be a non-negative power of 2)
16 <-- block size in bytes (will be a non-negative power of 2)
3 <-- level of associativity (number of blocks per set)
1 <-- replacement policy (will be 0 for random replacement, 1 for LRU)
1 <-- write policy (will be 0 for write-through, 1 for write-back)
13 <-- number of cycles required to write or read a block from the cache
230 <-- number of cycles required to write or read a block from main memory
0 <-- cache coherence protocol (0 for simple implementation, 1 for MESI, only used for 572 projects)
